Directions:
In order to run this program, begin by running a pull request from the GitHub repository.

After pulling the project, open it up and login with the appropriate username and password. You will then be brought to a page that shows all of the business's appointments. 
If you would like to add an appointment, modify an appointment, delete an appointment, view customers or view reports, you can navigate appropriately from this page. 

My Report: I decided to do an additional report that shows the appointments for the present day, as it seems important for everybody within a business to be on the same page about
what they can expect for the day.
